## LaTeX Snippet

There are already various snippets available for LaTeX, however snippets are defined in their customized manner, and it might get difficult to get your hands on their snippets by purely reading the code (not to mention the majority of snippets are regular expressions) So I created my own LaTeX snippets with brief syntax and well documented examples to facilitate easier usage and understanding. They are heavily inspired by [OrangeX4 snippets](https://github.com/OrangeX4/OrangeX4-HyperSnips), Mathematica Alias, [LaTeX Workshop Snippets](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop), [LaTeX Utilities](https://github.com/tecosaur/LaTeX-Utilities/wiki/Live-Snippets), this [famous notes on snips with LaTeX](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) and some other language syntaxes like markdown.
